This is a set of utility functions to directly read a SAS JMP binary file (version 10/11
were tested, JMP 9 likely does not work).  This does not depend on JMP
being installed; it does not use their API.  It can handle a wide variety of
column formats, but I couldn't test all options.

Input is the file name to read.  The return is typically a pandas dataframe.
Or you can write to a CSV.  An example usage is provided in jmptest.py, and
an example JMP file is given (TestFile.jmp).

Note that these only work with JMP files generated by SAS JMP on Windows.
I tried a Mac file and it did not work.  There are some differences, and
I didn't have the time to debug the mac files.  The differences are likely
small, so if needed, someone could probably figure it out.
